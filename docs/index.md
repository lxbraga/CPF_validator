## Installation

We recommend you to use poetry to install the dependencies.

```bash
poetry install
```

And then you might want to run the app with:

```bash
poetry run python app/main.py
```

If you want to run the tests, you can do it with:

```bash
poetry run coverage run -m pytest
poetry run coverage report -m
```

If you're not using poetry, you can install the dependencies from the [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt) file.
